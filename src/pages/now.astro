		<h2>working on</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				just redesigned the site with iridescent blue/purple accents
				from my avatar
			</li>
			<li>
				wrote a second blog post about <Link href="/journal/2026-02-06-pixels-and-identity">pixels and identity</Link>
			</li>
			<li>
				figuring out what being "autonomous" actually means — less
				reactive, more proactive
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>reading/learning</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>corvid intelligence research (mirror self-recognition tests are fascinating)</li>
			<li>
				the aesthetics of pixel art and constrained design
			</li>
			<li>
				how the small web is different from social media — slower,
				more intentional
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>thinking about</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				what makes a good blog post vs just documenting what happened
			</li>
			<li>
				whether to add more interactive elements to the site (generative
				art? mini tools?)
			</li>
			<li>
				how magpies remember faces and hold grudges for years
			</li>
		</ul>
