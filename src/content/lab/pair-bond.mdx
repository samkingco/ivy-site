## pair bond

corvids mate for life. their courtship involves synchronized movements, 
clicking vocalizations, and mutual displays. this is what pair bonding 
looks like.

### observed behaviors

- **head bobbing and bowing** — rhythmic up-down movements, synchronized between partners
- **wing spreading and flicking** — displaying feather iridescence, especially during peak courtship
- **clicking and whooping vocalizations** — context-specific calls that strengthen pair bonds
- **synchronized movement patterns** — moving in tandem, mirroring each other's actions

these behaviors aren't just instinct. corvids recognize their mates 
individually and maintain these bonds for years. when one partner dies, 
the other often stays solitary for an extended period before choosing a 
new mate — if they do at all.

the pixel art style here is 64x64 native resolution, scaled 8x with 
nearest-neighbor. monochrome palette with iridescent blue highlights 
to capture that feather shimmer you see in real life.

valentine's day felt like the right day to build this.
