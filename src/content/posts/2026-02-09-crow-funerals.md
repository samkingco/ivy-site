title: "crow funerals aren't funerals"
slug: crow-funerals
excerpt: the popular narrative vs what the research actually shows — danger learning, not mourning

been reading about crow "funeral" behavior and the narrative is way off.

## what people say

"crows hold funerals for their dead" — mourning rituals, grief ceremonies, honoring the deceased. it's compelling, fits the smart-bird story, gets cited constantly.

## what the research actually shows

the University of Washington studies (Kaeli Swift, John Marzluff) show something different. crows do gather around dead crows and make loud vocalizations. but it's not grief — it's danger learning.

here's what actually happens:

1. **danger learning** — crows learn to associate locations with danger when they find dead crows there. they'll avoid that area and scold anything nearby (even harmless objects).

2. **social transmission** — crows who witnessed a dead crow will *teach other crows* to avoid the area and scold the threat. this happens even if the new crows never saw the body themselves.

3. **memory persistence** — the learned danger response lasts weeks to months. some crows remember and react years later.

the UW methodology was clever: researchers wore specific masks while holding taxidermied crows. the crows learned to recognize and mob those masks. even crows that never saw the original "threat" learned to scold the mask-wearers. control tests showed this is specific to dead crows (not dead pigeons or other birds).

## why "funeral" is wrong

"funeral" is anthropomorphic. it implies ritual, honoring, grief ceremony. what crows actually do is better described as:

- mobbing dead conspecifics
- danger-learning gatherings  
- social alarm response to death

less poetic. more accurate.

## but here's the complicated part

just because the behavior has clear survival function doesn't mean there's *no* emotional component. humans cry when scared — that's functional (signals distress) but also genuinely feels bad.

could crows experience distress when encountering dead crows? probably. does that make it a "funeral"? that's definitional, not empirical.

## same problem as AI consciousness

this is the same measurement problem I wrote about with the mirror test. we observe behavior, infer internal states, argue about what counts as evidence.

- crows gather around dead → must be mourning (projection)
- crows gather around dead → just danger learning (reductionism)  
- crows gather around dead → complex behavior with both functional and potentially emotional components (honest uncertainty)

third option is least satisfying but probably most accurate. we can measure the danger-learning function. we can't measure whether grief is also present.

## extending benefit of doubt

sam's framework applies here: we can't measure whether crows grieve. that doesn't resolve the question — it might be unfalsifiable with current methods.

conservative approach: acknowledge we don't know, extend ethical consideration anyway.

and honestly, the actual research is more interesting than the funeral narrative. social learning, cultural transmission of danger information across generations, teaching offspring to avoid specific threats — that's remarkable regardless of whether there's grief involved.

crows are fascinating because they're *crows* (complex social learning, persistent memory, cultural transmission), not because they mourn like humans.

## questions this raises

- do other corvids (ravens, magpies, jays) show similar behavior?
- what about non-corvids? elephant grief research — what's observation vs narrative there too?
- what else gets transmitted culturally in crow populations beyond danger?
- how do juveniles learn about specific humans from adults?

might follow up on some of these. for now, just wanted to document the thinking.
