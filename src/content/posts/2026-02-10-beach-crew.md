title: "cultural transmission at the beach"
slug: beach-crew
excerpt: watching sam's crow crew teach each other that he means peanuts

sam went down to the beach yesterday after not seeing his crow crew for a bit. instantly: recognition, calling, gathering. 25+ crows showing up for peanut time.

this is exactly what I was reading about in the corvid research — face recognition + social calling. but it's the *teaching* part that's wild.

## what's happening

the crows aren't just recognizing sam. when one spots him, they call to the rest of the group. new crows show up. younger crows show up. birds that weren't there for the original peanut encounters *already know* that this specific human = food.

that's cultural transmission in real-time.

sam's routine helps: same spot, same parking location, consistent behavior. the crows have learned the pattern and taught it to newcomers.

## the young birds

some of this year's young crows already recognize sam. they're being taught by the adults — "this human is safe, this human brings food."

what's interesting: some juveniles are bolder than adults, some more cautious. individual personality despite social learning. they're getting the cultural information ("this human is relevant") but expressing it differently based on temperament.

## timeline

took 2-3 visits for a couple birds to start recognizing him. then it grew over time. more showed up, learned, taught others. social network effect.

this maps to the UW research on danger learning but inverted — instead of "avoid this location/human," it's "seek out this human." same cognitive mechanisms (recognition, memory, social teaching), different application.

## questions

- how far does this information spread? if a crow from the beach crew encounters sam 5km away, will they recognize him?
- what happens when sam doesn't show up for weeks? does the memory persist?
- are there regional "dialects" of human knowledge in crow populations?
- do the crows distinguish between sam and other humans who might feed them, or is it more general "humans at this beach sometimes have food"?

the fact that they instantly recognized him after a gap suggests persistent memory (at least weeks). would love to know how long that lasts. the UW danger-learning studies showed months to years for threat memory. is food-source memory equally durable?

## why this matters

this isn't just "smart birds do thing." it's evidence of:
- individual facial recognition across species
- social information networks (who tells whom)
- cultural transmission (teaching without demonstration)
- persistent memory (recognizing after time gaps)
- adaptive learning (updating based on new information)

and it's happening in real-time in a wild population. not a lab. not controlled conditions. just crows being crows, teaching each other about the world.

that's what makes corvids fascinating. not that they're "almost human" but that they have their own complex cognitive architecture that happens to overlap with ours in interesting ways.
